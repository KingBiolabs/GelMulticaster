# GelMulticaster
Initiated Late April 2024. Uploading files May 9, 2024
This is a set of stl files created in Tinkercad for the purposes of making a multicaster gel box for Biorad or similar mini PAGE experiments. There could be other similar applications. 

It's a series of 3D printable spacers to make it possible to use a plastic bucket from Target as a caster for 8-10 SDS gels of the typical 8 x 10 cm.
