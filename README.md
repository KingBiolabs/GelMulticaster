# GelMulticaster
Initiated Late April 2024. Uploading files May 9, 2024

3D printed files for converting a Target plastic box into a Bio-rad compatible multi-caster gel system.

need 2 curved backspacers - these go on either side of the long axis of the box. These account for the curved box and otherwise shorten the number of gel plates needed to make one casting.
need 2 side spacers - these go on either side of short axis of box. The two wedges should make a trough at the bottom. This allows the liquid to move between gel plates.
(optional) need 1 compression wedge to help apply tension to stack of glass gel plates.

Additional items needed:
1. You'll need glass gel plates for your mini-gel. The box holds about 8 - 10 plates depending on the spacer thickness of your gels. A typical 0.75 mm gel fits XX plates.
2. You'll need some plastic plates or sheet cut in a way to allow you to wedge the stack of plates tightly together.
3. You'll also need to buy a plastic bin or tray for holding the spacers together and keeping the unpolymerized acrylamide mixture in place while the gel sets.
